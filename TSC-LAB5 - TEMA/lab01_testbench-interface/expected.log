Reseting the instruction register...

Writing values to register stack...
Writing to register location 0:
  opcode = 1 (PASSA)
  operand_a = -12
  operand_b = 7

Writing to register location 1:
  opcode = 0 (ZERO)
  operand_a = -9
  operand_b = 1

Writing to register location 2:
  opcode = 7 (MOD)
  operand_a = -15
  operand_b = 8


Reading back the same register locations written...
Read from register location 0:
  opcode = 1 (PASSA)
  operand_a = -12
  operand_b = 7

Read from register location 1:
  opcode = 0 (ZERO)
  operand_a = -9
  operand_b = 1

Read from register location 2:
  opcode = 7 (MOD)
  operand_a = -15
  operand_b = 8
